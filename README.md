# üè† IntelliEstate : House Price Prediction Model

## ‚ú®Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to predict real estate prices for properties in Bangalore, India.

## ‚ú®Project Highlights
- `Predictive Model`: Developed a robust machine learning model using the Pandas and Scikit-learn libraries. This model leverages regression techniques to accurately predict house prices.
- `Data Preprocessing`: Advanced preprocessing techniques, including standardization and one-hot encoding. This ensures that our data is properly transformed and ready for modeling.
- `Data Cleaning`: We have meticulously cleaned the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring data quality.
- `Feature Engineering`: Our project demonstrates expertise in feature engineering, allowing us to extract valuable information from the dataset and improve prediction accuracy.
- `Model Evaluation`: Our model has been rigorously evaluated using various metrics, with an Best Score of 0.847796 indicating strong predictive power.

## ü§ñTechnologies Used
- `Python`: The primary programming language for data analysis, model building, and server development.
- `Numpy and Pandas`: Essential libraries for data cleaning, manipulation, and preprocessing.
- `Matplotlib`: A powerful tool for data visualization, aiding in understanding the dataset and model performance.
- `Scikit-Learn`: The go-to library for machine learning model building, including regression models and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- `Jupyter Notebook`: An interactive environment for data exploration and model prototyping.
